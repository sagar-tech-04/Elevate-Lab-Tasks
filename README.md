Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship – Nmap & Wireshark Tasks:
This repository contains the work completed during my cybersecurity internship at Elevate Labs, where I performed hands-on tasks using Nmap and Wireshark.
The objective of these tasks was to understand real-world network scanning, packet analysis, service enumeration, and security investigation techniques.

The tasks helped me build strong practical skills in reconnaissance, vulnerability identification, packet inspection, and network behaviour analysis.

Tools used: Nmap, Wireshark.

Repository Structure: I attached screenshots, Task1_ElevateLabs_Cybersecurity.pdf, and nmap_scan_capture_task1.pcap.

🚀 Tasks Performed
1️⃣ Nmap Scanning Task

Performed detailed network scanning to identify open ports, running services, OS fingerprinting, firewall behaviour, and vulnerabilities.

✔ Steps I Performed

Ran basic scans (nmap <target>)

Performed service version detection (-sV)

Used aggressive mode scans (-A)

Conducted OS detection (-O)

Saved scan results in .txt and .xml formats

Interpreted results and identified security weaknesses

✔ Key Learnings

Detecting open ports and services

Understanding service banners

Recognising vulnerable configurations

Difference between SYN scan, UDP scan, and aggressive scan

2️⃣ Wireshark Packet Analysis Task

Analysed packets from network traffic to understand protocols, identify suspicious activity, and decode communication patterns.

✔ Steps I Performed

Captured live packets using Wireshark

Applied filters (http, tcp.port==80, dns, icmp, etc.)

Inspected TCP handshakes and teardown packets

Analysed HTTP GET/POST requests

Studied DNS queries and responses

Exported pcap files and documented findings

✔ Key Learnings

Breaking down packet headers (Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP)

Understanding how data moves across the network

Identifying anomalies and suspicious packets

Recognising failed logins, ARP spoofing patterns, etc.
